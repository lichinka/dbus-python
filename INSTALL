Installation
============

First, run the configure.py script to set the paths to the DBus and DBus-Glib headers and libraries, e.g.:

$ ./configure.py -l /usr/lib -i /usr/lib/dbus/include -i /usr/lib/glib/include

This will create a setup.cfg file that stores the location of the found headers and libraries. 
Now, you can use the standard Python setup.py script as so:

$ ./setup.py install

To build the package in-place (i.e. without installing), run the configure script as specified above, and then do:

$ ./setup.py build_ext --inplace
